echo "Introduction to Linux and shells
Linux is an operating system, like macOS or Windows.
It is also the most popular Open Source and free, as in freedom, operating
system.
It powers the vast majority of the servers that compose the Internet. It's the
base upon which everything is built upon. But not just that. Android is based
on (a modified version of) Linux.
The Linux "core" (called kernel) was born in 1991 in Finland, and it went a
really long way from its humble beginnings. It went on to be the kernel of the
GNU Operating System, creating the duo GNU/Linux.
There's one thing about Linux that corporations like Microsoft and Apple, or
Google, will never be able to offer: the freedom to do whatever you want with
your computer.
They're actually going in the opposite direction, building walled gardens,
especially on the mobile side.
Linux is the ultimate freedom." > $filename
